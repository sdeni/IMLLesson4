# Loan eligibility prediction

## Company should decide on giving loans for a customers, based on their application form data

Now the process is not automated, and the company use experts to decide on loans. The company wants to automate the process. Decision should be made real-time. The form fields are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.

We need to create a binary classification model, decide if the application form should be extended, and decide if we can switch to a fully automated decision making or use some variant of human-machine system.
